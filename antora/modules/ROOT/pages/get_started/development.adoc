To run the linter tools suite you may use https://pre-commit.com[pre-commit].

[,shell]

pip install pre-commit
pre-commit run -a

[#tests]
== Tests

[#unit-tests]
=== Unit tests

Tests are executed using https://tox.wiki/en/latest/[tox].

[,shell]
----
pip install .[test]
tox

[#documentation]
== Documentation

This documentation uses http://www.sphinx-doc.org/[Sphinx] and was generated using https://mkdocs.org/[MkDocs] and https://mkdocstrings.github.io/[mkdocstrings].

[#setup]
=== Setup

Add the `docs` extra when installing `pylaia`:

[,shell]
----
# In a clone of the Git repository
pip install .[docs]

Build the documentation using `mkdocs serve -v`. You can then write in https://www.markdownguide.org/[Markdown] in the relevant `docs/*.md` files, and see live output on http://localhost:8000.
